    "Data Structure: You used a list to store the remaining stops and repeatedly removed the nearest one.\n",
    "While this approach works, it has a time complexity of O(n) for each stop's removal since all elements to the right need to be shifted.\n",
    "A more efficient approach is to use a data structure like a priority queue (heap) to store the stops based on their distance from the current location.\n",

    "In practice, for a small number of delivery stops, your approach is perfectly reasonable.\n",
