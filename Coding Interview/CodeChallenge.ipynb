He knows that after traveling some distance, he can find a magic source that will enable the carpet to travel a further distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are n magical sources along the circular path numbered from 0 to n-1. Initially, the carpet has no magic and Aladdin can use a portal to jump to any magical source and start his journey. The carpet consumes units of magic equal to the units of distance travelled. He needs to choose a point to start his journey that will allow him to complete his journey. Determine the lowest index of the starting points from which Aladdin can start his journey and visit all of the places in the circular path in order. If there is no solution, return -1.\n",

He transports there without cost and collects 3 units of magic. The distance to the next point is dist[0] = 2. It takes 2 units of magic to get there and he collects magic[1] = 2 units upon arrival, so he has 3 - 2 +2 = 3 units of magic after making his first carpet ride. Continuing along the journey: \n",

    "At this point, he is back to the first source. Because he can complete his journey starting at source magic[0], there is no reason to continue with the analysis so its index, 0, is returned. To illustrate a point from the same example, if he starts at position 2, where magic[1] = 2 and dist[1] = 3, he will not be able to proceed to the next point because the distance is greater than his magic units. Note that the list is circular, so from magic[3] in this example, the next source on the path is magic[0].\n",
