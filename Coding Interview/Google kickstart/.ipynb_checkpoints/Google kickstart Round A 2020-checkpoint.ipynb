We could replace oj with the absent element in A without worsening the solution, because there will always be element in A that is not in O. We then increased number of elements in common between A and O, hence we can repeat this operation only finite number of times.

In order to compute dp[][] efficiently, we need to be able to efficiently answer the question: What is the sum of the first x plates from stack i? We can precompute this once for all N stacks. Let sum[i][x] denote the sum of first x plates from stack i.\n",

Therefore, in order to pick j plates in total from i stacks, we can pick anywhere between [0, 1, ..., j] plates from the i-th stack and [j, j-1, ..., 0] plates from the previous i-1 stacks respectively. Also, we need to do this for all values of 1 ≤ j ≤ P.\n",
